# hello-world
Just working through the tutorial info. 
I have a little experience programming from undergrad and grad school, but I am relearning a lot right now.  My goal is to apply experience and knowledge as a mathematics and statistics instructor in data analytics.  I'm looking for different projects to apply newly learned techniques to.
